# Memory Game for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

## Game Description

There are eight pairs of cards on the board. The object of the game is to match the pairs as fast as you can and in the least amount of turns. You can only turn over two cards at a time and pairs that you match will stay turned over. The game ends when all eight pairs are matched.
